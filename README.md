# alt presskit()

Is a free (both as in speech and as in beer) alternative to the excellent [presskit()](http://dopresskit.com/)

## Why make an alternative?

Rami is one of the busiest people on earth, and while presskit() is pretty great, it's not perfect. By making a new version, using open source and the accompanying collaboration methods I hope to make it even better. 

Pull requests are welcomed, but keep in mind the intent: Stay minimal and efficient. No bloat.

The idea is also to stay backwards compatible with the original, but this may change in the future.
